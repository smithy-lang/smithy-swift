There are two ways to grant the appropriate permissions using the request headers.
            
            * Specify a canned ACL using the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see [Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).
            
            * Specify access permissions explicitly using the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-write, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. These headers map to the set of permissions Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see [Access control list (ACL) overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html). You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:
            
            * id – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account
            
            * uri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group
            
            * emailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:
            
            * US East (N. Virginia)
            
            * US West (N. California)
            
            * US West (Oregon)

            * Europe (Ireland)
            
            * South America (São Paulo)

            For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants the Amazon Web Services accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata: x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666"
            
            
            You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both. Permissions If your CreateBucket request specifies ACL permissions and the ACL is public-read, public-read-write, authenticated-read, or if you specify access permissions explicitly through any other ACL, both s3:CreateBucket and s3:PutBucketAcl permissions are needed. If the ACL the CreateBucket request is private, only s3:CreateBucket permission is needed. If ObjectLockEnabledForBucket is set to true in your CreateBucket request, s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration and s3:PutBucketVersioning permissions are required.
