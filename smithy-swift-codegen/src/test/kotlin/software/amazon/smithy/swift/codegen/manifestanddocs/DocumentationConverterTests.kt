Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner. Not every string is an acceptable bucket name. For information about bucket naming restrictions, see [Bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html). If you want to create an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, see [Create Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_CreateBucket.html). By default, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You can optionally specify a Region in the request body. You might choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside in Europe, you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the Europe (Ireland) Region. For more information, see [Accessing a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro). If you send your create bucket request to the s3.amazonaws.com endpoint, the request goes to the us-east-1 Region.

When creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the bucket. There are two ways to grant the appropriate permissions using the request headers.
            
            * Specify a canned ACL using the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see [Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).
            
            * Specify access permissions explicitly using the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-write, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. These headers map to the set of permissions Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see [Access control list (ACL) overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html). You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:
            
            * id – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account
            
            * uri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group
            
            * emailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:
            
            * US East (N. Virginia)
            
            * US West (N. California)
            
            * US West (Oregon)
            
            * Asia Pacific (Singapore)
            
            * Asia Pacific (Sydney)
            
            * Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
            
            * Europe (Ireland)
            
            * South America (São Paulo)
            
            
            For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see [Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
            
            
            For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants the Amazon Web Services accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata: x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666"
            
            
            You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both. Permissions If your CreateBucket request specifies ACL permissions and the ACL is public-read, public-read-write, authenticated-read, or if you specify access permissions explicitly through any other ACL, both s3:CreateBucket and s3:PutBucketAcl permissions are needed. If the ACL the CreateBucket request is private, only s3:CreateBucket permission is needed. If ObjectLockEnabledForBucket is set to true in your CreateBucket request, s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration and s3:PutBucketVersioning permissions are required. The following operations are related to CreateBucket:
